# PRODIGY_ML_03

Classify Images of cats and dogs Using Support Vector Machine(SVM).

## Features

  - This project aims to implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to accurately distinguish images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.
  - SVMs are a powerful machine learning algorithm known for their ability to handle high-dimensional data and complex decision boundaries.
  -  Linear regression will be used to explore relationships between these features and house prices and to make predictions on new data.

## Dataset

  - Custom Dataset: You'll need to provide a dataset containing images of cats and dogs. Ensure the images are labeled correctly (e.g., "cat" or "dog").

## Implementation Steps

  1.Data Preprocessing:

    - Load the dataset into memory.
    - Resize images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224) for uniformity.
    - Convert images to a suitable format (e.g., NumPy arrays).
    - Normalize pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0-1).
    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

  2.Feature Extraction:

    - Extract relevant features from the images using techniques like:
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): If computational resources allow, CNNs can be used to learn complex features automatically.
    - Handcrafted features: Consider using features like color histograms, texture descriptors, or edge detection.

  3.SVM Model Training:

    - Create an SVM classifier instance.
    - Tune hyperparameters (e.g., kernel type, regularization parameter) using techniques like grid search or cross-validation.
    - Train the SVM model on the training set.

  4.Model Evaluation:

    - Use the trained SVM model to predict labels for the testing set.
    - Calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Analyze the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.
